# Palestinian Accent Recognition System

üîç Description:This project focuses on recognizing Palestinian dialects from audio files using machine learning techniques.
## üéØ Project Overview
The project involves the following key components:

Loading Audio Files: Load audio files from specified directories.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features such as MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast from the audio data.

Model Training: Train a RandomForestClassifier on the extracted features.

Prediction: Predict the dialect of a given audio file.

GUI Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction, including file selection, dialect prediction, and report generation.
## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies
Make sure to install the following dependencies before running the project:

pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn librosa pyaudio pydub tkinter

## Functions:

load_audio_files(directory_path): Loads audio files from a given directory.

extract_features(audio_data): Extracts MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast features from the audio data.

prepare_data(data_dirs, labels): Prepares the data for training/testing by loading and extracting features.

predict_dialect(clf, le, audio_file): Predicts the dialect of a given audio file.

train_model_and_generate_initial_report(): Trains the model and generates an initial classification report.

convert_to_wav(file_path): Converts an audio file to WAV format.

play_sound(filename): Plays an audio file.

select_file(entry_widget): Handles file selection through a GUI.

clear_entry(entry_widget): Clears the entry widget in the GUI.

predict_dialect_ui(entry_widget): Handles dialect prediction through the GUI.

print_report(): Prints the classification report in the GUI.
